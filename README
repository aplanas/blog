## How to Contribute

Please add new blog posts in the /_posts folder, using standard Jekyll markdown and metadata.

Using an existing blog post as reference is a good idea for first time blog posts, just be sure to change all of the dates/times in the header to a valid (new) date so your new blog post is posted in the right order.
